An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy where the epidemic started on February We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date April and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature The peak occurs at day March approximately when there is a rapid decrease with a reproduction ratio initially at day and after day indicating different degrees of lockdown The predicted death toll is casualties with million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is days and the infection period is days with a fatality rate of based on the reported official number of The infection fatality rate IFR is and if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed However these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods we observe that a higher incubation period versus days gives the same IFR versus but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case Therefore a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemicThe pair coupled cluster doubles pCCD method where the excitation manifold is restricted to electron pairs has a series of interesting features Among others it provides energies very close to what is obtained with configuration interaction DOCI but with polynomial cost compared with the exponential cost of the latter Here we address whether this similarity holds for excited states by exploring the symmetric dissociation of the linear molecule When HF orbitals are employed pCCD and DOCI energies do not match a feature that is assigned to the poor HF reference In contrast by optimizing the orbitals at the pCCD level specifically for each excited state the discrepancies between pCCD and DOCI decrease by one or two orders of magnitude Therefore the pCCD and DOCI methodologies still provide comparable energies for excited states but only if suitable orbitals are adopted We also assessed whether a pCCD approach could be used to directly target states without having to resort to the EOM formalism In our model excitation energies were extracted from the energy difference between separate calculations for the ground state and the targeted excited state For a set comprising the states of nitroxyl nitrosomethane and formaldehyde we found that provides quite accurate excitation energies with root mean square deviations with respect to full configuration interaction results lower than and comparable to two methods with much higher computational costStylolites are ubiquitous observed in rocks in the upper crust from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones in folds faults and shear zones These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores Consequently they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the crust They are observed individually or in networks in proximity to fractures and joints and in numerous geological settings This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis The main questions this review focuses on are the following How do they How can they be used to measure strain and formation How do they control fluid flow in the upper Geometrically stylolites have fractal roughness with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes a scaling with Hurst exponent at small scale up to tens or hundreds of microns another one with Hurst exponent around to at intermediate scale up to millimeters or centimeters and in the case of sedimentary stylolites a flat scaling at large scale More complicated anisotropic scaling scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered is found in the case of tectonic stylolites We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics including a mechanical component for the associated with stress concentrations and a precise tracking of the influence of heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed We show that although stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries Finally the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude its scalar value perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites We also show that the crossover between medium millimetric scales and large pluricentimetric scales in the case of sedimentary stylolites provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve which leads to the loss of information since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible or may reduce the permeability depending on the development of the stylolite Highlights Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure stress and fluids Stylolite geometry fractal and properties network structure are investigated The experiments and numerical models for their formation are reviewed Stylolites can be used as markers of strain paleostress orientation and magnitude Stylolites impact transport properties as function of maturity and flow directionThe fundamental properties of macroscopic dynamic evolutionary systems are investigated A model is proposed to describe a large class of systems within population genetics We focus on a single locus arbitrary number alleles in a dioecious population Our governing equations are continuous differential equations labeled by a set of genotype frequencies The full parameter space consists of all allowed parameters of these genotype frequencies Our equations are uniquely derived from four fundamental assumptions within a population a closed system mating process behavior Mendelian inheritance exponential growth and exponential death Even though our equations are with time evolutionary dynamics we have an exactly solvable model Our findings are summarized from two viewpoints First from the phenomenological viewpoint any initial genotype frequency of a closed system will eventually approach a stable fixed point Under time evolution we show the monotonic behavior of genotype frequencies a genotype or an allele that ever presents in the population will never become extinct the law and the global stability without chaos in the parameter space To demonstrate the experimental evidence as an example we show an mapping from the blood type genotype frequencies of world ethnic groups to our stable solutions Second from the mathematical viewpoint the equilibrium solutions consist of a base manifold as a global stable attractor attracting any initial point in a Euclidean fiber to the fixed point where this fiber is attached We can define the genetic distance of two populations as their geodesic distance on the equilibrium manifold In addition the modification of our theory under the process of natural selection and mutation are addressedWe study effective and interactions between colloidal inclusions in an active bath of chiral or particles using Brownian Dynamics simulations within a standard model of inclusions and active particles In a active bath we first corroborate previous findings on effective repulsion mediated between the inclusions by elucidating the detailed features of the force profiles including a primary maximum and a secondary hump at larger separations that was not previously reported We then show that these features arise directly from the formation and sequential overlaps of circular layers or rings of active particles around the inclusions as the latter are brought to small surface separations These rings extend to radial distances of a few radii from the surface of inclusions giving the inclusions relatively thick soft repulsive shoulders whose multiple overlaps then enable significant forces in both and chiral active baths The resulting forces can even exceed the forces in magnitude and display distinct repulsive and attractive regimes at intermediate to large strengths In a chiral active bath we show that while active particles still tend to accumulate at the immediate vicinity of the inclusions they exhibit strong depletion from the intervening region between the inclusions and partial depletion from relatively thick circular zones further away from the inclusions In this case the effective predominantly repulsive interactions between the inclusions turn to active attractions acting over an extended range of separationsThis paper describes a study of the generation of a plughole vortex and its consequences in a drainpipe during drainage of water from a stationary rectangular tank The critical and minimum depths of water above the inlet of the drainpipe where a surface dip starts to develop for drainpipes of various diameters were examined parametrically This study explored the following naturally occurring phenomena arising from a plughole vortex i A plughole vortex initially causes a surface dip to develop towards the inlet of the drainpipe and as the surface dip approaches the inlet of the drainpipe it creates a air bubble ii A unique bubble transformation from a to a bubble ring occurs just after the separation of the air bubble from the surface dip iii The bubble ring flows with the drain water and initially causes bubbly flow in the drainpipe iv As the water head above the inlet of the drainpipe decreases the bubble size increases and consequently the bubble ring size increases and causes slug flow in the drainpipe v As the slugs combine the flow of the draining water eventually becomes annular flow in the
